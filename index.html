Second sesssion now done. I've setup the Github organization, checked various
social media channels to make sure the username of DevelopEXp was available.
Trying to get DEX everywhere would be near impossible so I've settled for
DevelopEXp everywhere. I've also started the public site for this, starting with
a simple HTML webpage. Time for my 5 minute break (working in pomodoro schedule
of 25 on and 5 off).

My first 25 minute session working on DEX included me writing out the initial
ideas, goals, names, etc. in my fancy notebook that I got to build a startup.
I'm excited to start building this idea, 25 minutes at a time and blogging the
whole way through.
