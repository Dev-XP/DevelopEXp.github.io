So I was going to make STM executable, but then realized that I wanted a quick
way to publish STM. I had to play around with a couple of configurations and end
on a simple bash script that runs a `patch` run script and then runs `npm
publish`. I had to do it seprately because prepublish took the version it was
ran with rather than the new version created by the `patch` script. Oh well. So
now I can publish quickly, which means the next session I will make it
installable and executable. Time to learn how to setup a `bin` script for a node
package.

Third session was about setting up the first major product provided by DEX...
STM (https://www.npmjs.com/package/s-t-m). STM stands for "Services, Tools,
Modules" and the goal of it is to be able to build microservice architectures
super quickly... like in an hour and pushed to production. I believe this can be
done efficiently following a specific set of opinionated software engienering
principles without sacrificing quality and flexibility in growth. I think the
next session is trying to get it executable.

Second sesssion now done. I've setup the Github organization, checked various
social media channels to make sure the username of DevelopEXp was available.
Trying to get DEX everywhere would be near impossible so I've settled for
DevelopEXp everywhere. I've also started the public site for this, starting with
a simple HTML webpage. Time for my 5 minute break (working in pomodoro schedule
of 25 on and 5 off).

My first 25 minute session working on DEX included me writing out the initial
ideas, goals, names, etc. in my fancy notebook that I got to build a startup.
I'm excited to start building this idea, 25 minutes at a time and blogging the
whole way through.
