#7

Day #2 - starting by planning out the first STM command which will be `stm
init`. This will create the project directory structure of "services". "tools",
and "modules" and store the project settings in "./.root.json". These settings
exist to provide a path for idempotency as well as an easy upgrade path so
re-running a command can be re-run with past settings. This will be a common
pattern for all code generation in STM. I also did some research into how I
expect to do testing for STM so it remains stable. This is essentially a more
specific "Slush" so I've been looking into testing for gulp/slush. Hopefully
using a stream system with RxJS will make testing a bit easier. We'll see in the
second session of the day.


#6

Spent some time writing down initial details on STM and planning where to go
from here. Did a lot of research on Commander and Liftoff as well as their
dependencies. Liftoff would be nice to use if I want a config file, but I don't
think I will need one early on since the goal of STM is to provide an
opinionated approach first. Commander will be good to use as it will provide
solid help information that I can utilize as well as parsing of arguments and
parsing of those arguments. I can use those arguments as "pre-filling" in
inquirer prompts. I think I will take one more session of STM planning before
starting to build because I have to think of what commands to start with and how
they will interact. The goal is also to have STM be idempotent for safety sake
of affecting projects, so I'll have to consider how to do that well as well as
consider "upgrade" paths for projects using STM. For now I break for breakfast.


#5

So I've made STM easy to publish and it now is executable. I also had time to
setup babel and es6 with a build pipeline to only publish what I want it to
publish. Sure I could use like npm ignore, but I have to build babel somewhere
so I might as well copy the relevant files to the same distribution folder. Next
I need to look at commander and making STM an actual CLI tool with commands and
everything. I may have to look at other CLI packages and stuff, but commander
will be a good place to start looking.


#4

So I was going to make STM executable, but then realized that I wanted a quick
way to publish STM. I had to play around with a couple of configurations and end
on a simple bash script that runs a `patch` run script and then runs `npm
publish`. I had to do it seprately because prepublish took the version it was
ran with rather than the new version created by the `patch` script. Oh well. So
now I can publish quickly, which means the next session I will make it
installable and executable. Time to learn how to setup a `bin` script for a node
package.


#3

Third session was about setting up the first major product provided by DEX...
STM (https://www.npmjs.com/package/s-t-m). STM stands for "Services, Tools,
Modules" and the goal of it is to be able to build microservice architectures
super quickly... like in an hour and pushed to production. I believe this can be
done efficiently following a specific set of opinionated software engienering
principles without sacrificing quality and flexibility in growth. I think the
next session is trying to get it executable.


#2

Second sesssion now done. I've setup the Github organization, checked various
social media channels to make sure the username of DevelopEXp was available.
Trying to get DEX everywhere would be near impossible so I've settled for
DevelopEXp everywhere. I've also started the public site for this, starting with
a simple HTML webpage. Time for my 5 minute break (working in pomodoro schedule
of 25 on and 5 off).


#1

My first 25 minute session working on DEX included me writing out the initial
ideas, goals, names, etc. in my fancy notebook that I got to build a startup.
I'm excited to start building this idea, 25 minutes at a time and blogging the
whole way through.
